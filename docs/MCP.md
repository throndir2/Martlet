# MCP in Martlet

Martlet speaks the Model Context Protocol in both directions:

- **As a client** (below): MCP servers on your PC give Martlet tools it can use while
  you talk.
- **As a server** ([Local MCP control](#local-mcp-control-windows)): `Martlet.Mcp`
  lets an MCP client run Martlet's diagnostics and drive its desktop UI.

## Tools while you talk (MCP client)

Add MCP servers on **Companion > Tools** (*Edit servers (mcp.json)*). The file is
`mcp.json` in Martlet's data folder and uses the format Claude Desktop, Cursor and
Cline use (VS Code's `"servers"` key works too; comments and trailing commas are
accepted), so a server's published configuration can be pasted as is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "${userHome}\\Documents"]
    },
    "my-http-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:MY_SERVER_TOKEN}" },
      "autoApprove": ["search"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **stdio** servers (`command`, `args`, optional `env` and `cwd`) run as programs on
  this PC with your permissions. `npx`/`.cmd` commands are started through
  `cmd.exe` with safe quoting. Every server Martlet starts is in one Windows job
  object, so it ends when Martlet ends (even if Martlet is killed).
- **Streamable HTTP** servers (`"type": "http"`, `url`, optional `headers`) are
  reached with MCP sessions; the older SSE transport is not supported.
- `${env:NAME}` and `${userHome}` are expanded, so secrets can stay in environment
  variables instead of the plain-text file. A missing variable stops only that server.
- `"disabled": true` turns a server off; `"autoApprove"` lists tools that run without
  asking (`true` or `"*"` for every tool of that server). The Tools page edits these
  for you (comments in the file are not kept when it does).

**When servers run.** Nothing starts when Martlet starts. Enabled servers start in
the background when you open a talk window (or press *Start servers now*), and a
reply waits at most 10 seconds for servers still starting. Servers that stopped are
retried when a talk window opens again or from the Tools page. Each server's state,
tools and recent error output are on the Tools page.

**Which replies get tools.** Only replies to what you say or type, and only when
Thinking uses OpenAI or a Chat Completions endpoint (local Ollama, LM Studio,
OpenRouter, NVIDIA Build...). Screen and camera glances and memory requests never
get tools, and a paired Martlet host's gateway has no function calling, so replies
from a host's model don't offer tools. If the model rejects a request because it
doesn't support tools (many small local models), Martlet asks it once more without
tools and stops offering them to that model until Martlet restarts.

**Confirmations.** Before each call the talk window shows the tool, its server and
the exact arguments, with *Allow once*, *Always allow this tool* and *Deny*; it is
part of the talk window (not a separate dialog), so answering doesn't end the
action. Unanswered calls are declined after 60 seconds, and a declined call tells
the model so. *Always allow* adds the tool to the server's `autoApprove` list.
The model, not you, chooses what to pass, and text a tool reads (a web page, file
or email) can try to steer it, so only skip confirmation for tools whose effects
you are comfortable with.

**Servers other features manage.** A Martlet feature can add its own server with
`McpToolService.SetManagedServer(name, definition with ManagedBy, policy)` (for example a Home
Assistant MCP endpoint). It is never written to mcp.json, appears on the Tools page as
managed by that feature, and loses to an mcp.json entry with the same name. Its
`policy(tool, arguments)` decides each call first: `AutoApprove`, `AskEveryTime` (no
*Always allow*), `Deny` (the model is told it's blocked) or `Default` (the normal
rules); a policy that throws counts as `AskEveryTime`. Managed servers never offer
*Always allow*.

**What is sent where.** Tool names, descriptions and parameter schemas go to the
Thinking model with each reply that offers tools; each tool result (cut to 12,000
characters, and to the reply's 64 KB tool budget) goes to the same model. The model
is told that tool output is data, not instructions.

**Bounds.** At most 128 tools (96 KB of descriptions) per reply, 16 calls per round
and 4 tool rounds per reply; each round is one more LLM request under the same
action, and the reply's last request must answer in text. A tool call has 60
seconds; a reply that may use tools has 140 seconds inside the 150-second action.
Calls run one at a time. The Tools page lists recent tool use (server, tool,
outcome and a short argument preview) until Martlet closes; it is never written to
disk.

**Protocol.** Martlet's client implements MCP 2025-06-18 (and accepts servers that
answer with 2025-03-26 or 2024-11-05): `initialize`, `tools/list` (with paging and
`notifications/tools/list_changed`), `tools/call` and `notifications/cancelled` when
a reply stops. It declares no client capabilities, so servers can't ask it for
sampling, roots or elicitation. Text, resource text and structured results reach
the model; images and audio are described, not sent. The client library is
`src\Martlet.Mcp.Client`; the Desktop glue is `McpToolService`.
## Local MCP control (Windows)

`Martlet.Mcp` is a local stdio Model Context Protocol server. It does not listen
on a network port, start the desktop, or activate a provider, microphone or
speaker on launch. Configure an MCP client to start the Windows executable
built from `src\Martlet.Mcp` (for development:
`src\Martlet.Mcp\bin\Release\net10.0-windows\Martlet.Mcp.exe`). The server
speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 on standard input/output; stderr is for
diagnostics. This developer companion is not included in the existing internal
installer payload. Build locally with:

```powershell
dotnet build src\Martlet.Mcp\Martlet.Mcp.csproj -c Release
```

For example, a client configuration with an absolute executable path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "martlet": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\Martlet.Mcp.exe",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

The headless tools `doctor_status`, `doctor_list` and `doctor_run` call the
production Doctor implementation in-process. Status and selected probes are
local read-only checks. They return Doctor's structured JSON report and exit
code; nonzero exit codes describe incomplete, failed or invalid results, not a
passed check. An optional absolute `dataDirectory` argument isolates settings
reads; without it, Doctor uses the current user's Martlet directory. No
headless MCP tool creates a profile, opens a device, plays a tone, sends a
request or handles credentials.

To drive the visible desktop, start `Martlet.Desktop.exe` yourself in the **same
interactive Windows session** (ideally with a disposable `--data-directory`).
Call `ui_connect` with that process ID. `ui_snapshot` returns window accessible names,
automation IDs, enabled states, checkbox states, and selected read-only status
fields; it does not dump arbitrary editable fields or credentials. `ui_click`
invokes a control by automation ID and `ui_select` selects a named combo-box
option. By default only passive navigation and
diagnostics controls can be clicked. The main window is split into pages, and a
page's controls are only visible after you open it: click `NavHome`,
`NavDevices`, `NavCompanion` or `NavSettings` first (for example
`NavCompanion` before `OpenSetup`). On Settings, click `DiagnosticsSection` to
expand the pipeline and status fields. On a fresh data directory, `TourSkip`
dismisses the welcome tour. Use `ui_snapshot` again to observe asynchronous effects. Modal
actions may return `completed: false` while their dialog remains open; this
means the invoke is still pending, not that the action finished.

Window discovery uses visible top-level native handles filtered to the attached
process, then verifies ownership around each UI Automation handle lookup.
This avoids transient omissions from UI Automation's desktop-root enumeration
when unrelated WPF windows close. The Martlet main-window automation ID is
still required on every operation; hidden, closed or changed-owner windows
fail rather than falling back to another process. Same-process dialogs remain
available, and duplicate control IDs still fail as ambiguous.

For broader **explicitly authorized** live UI testing, start the MCP server
with `--allow-ui-effects`. This unlocks arbitrary ID-based `ui_click` and
`ui_select`, plus `ui_set_text` and `ui_toggle`. It does **not** waive the
desktop's own per-action confirmations, spending/data disclosures, or Stop
controls. This opt-in can allow the LLM to approve chargeable provider calls,
audio capture/playback, credential actions and file operations by manipulating
the UI; only enable it for an attended, isolated test with the intended
permissions and budget. Do not use a real profile or provide this flag to an
untrusted MCP client. UI Automation needs an unlocked interactive desktop and
can fail in an unattended/headless session; use Doctor's headless tools there.
An automation click is not proof of actual microphone, speaker or provider
readiness.
