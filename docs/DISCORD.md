# Discord

Martlet can live on Discord: it hosts its own Discord bot inside the Martlet process, chats in DMs and the server
channels you allow, joins voice channels to talk and listen, and calls the people it knows. This page records what
Discord allows, how Martlet is built around it and the work in progress.

## What Discord allows (researched October 2026)

| Wish | Possible? | How Martlet does it |
|---|---|---|
| Martlet has its own Discord account | **Bot account only.** Logging in a normal user account from code (a "self-bot") breaks Discord's Terms of Service and gets the account banned, so Martlet never does it. | Martlet's own Discord application and bot user, with its name and the character's picture. |
| Friends list, friend requests | **No.** Bots cannot have friends or accept friend requests (the relationships API rejects bots). | **People** list in Martlet (the owner plus the people Martlet knows). They DM the bot after sharing a server with it, or install Martlet's app on their own account. |
| Martlet starts a private call with someone | **Not a DM call.** Bots cannot start or join DM or group-DM calls. | Martlet **calls** someone by opening a private voice channel in its **home server** (a small server the owner makes for Martlet), DMing them a link and joining it. |
| Invited to a group chat (group DM) | **Commands only.** Bots cannot be members of group DMs; a user-installed app's slash commands work there. | Martlet's app installs on a person's account (user install), so `/martlet` works in any DM or group DM. It cannot read the group's messages on its own. |
| Join server voice calls, speak and listen | **Yes.** Voice is end-to-end encrypted (DAVE) for every call since March 2026; the bot library must support it. | NetCord voice (send and receive, DAVE) with `/join`, `/leave`, being dragged into a channel and following the owner. |
| Show the character as its webcam | **No.** The bot API has no camera or Go Live video; streaming video means self-botting. | The bot's avatar and banner follow the character; posted snapshots of the model. A Discord Activity (Embedded App) showing the live character in a call is a possible later step; it needs a public HTTPS address. |
| Answer in server chats, configurable | **Yes.** Needs the Message Content privileged intent, which a bot under 10,000 users turns on itself in the Developer Portal. | Per server and per channel: Off, Mentions, Sometimes (Martlet decides) or Always. |
| Create the Discord app for the user | **No API for it.** Applications are created in the Developer Portal by hand. | A guided setup with links to the portal and the exact switches, then the token goes in Windows Credential Manager and Martlet builds the invite links. |

## Setting up (owner)

Everything happens on **Companion › Discord**, which walks through these steps (its first line always says what to do next):

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (**Open the Developer Portal**) and choose
   **New Application**. Name it after your character.
2. On **Bot**: **Reset Token**, copy it and paste it into **Bot token**, then **Save and connect**. Martlet checks that it looks
   like a bot token, keeps it in Windows Credential Manager (never in `discord.json`, logs or MCP) and connects. **Forget the
   bot** disconnects and removes it.
3. Still on **Bot**, under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, turn on **Message Content Intent**. Without it Discord refuses the
   connection (close code 4014) and the page says so, with a button to the bot's page; **Reconnect** afterwards.
4. On **Installation**, allow both **Guild Install** and **User Install**.
5. In Martlet, use **Add to a server** for each server and **Add to home server** for your own small server (it may also make
   private call channels), and **Add to my account** to use `/martlet` in DMs and group DMs. Each link has a Copy button.
6. Under **People on Discord**, set your own account: DM the bot and choose **That's me**, or paste your user ID (Discord's
   Settings › Advanced › Developer Mode, then right-click your name › Copy User ID). Pick the home server there too.

**Connection** turns the bot on or off (it then connects whenever Martlet runs) and shows its state, name, server count and any
problem. **Where Martlet chats** sets the server, DM and voice chat modes (Off, Only when mentioned, Sometimes, Always), whether
anyone may DM it, and per-channel rules picked from the connected bot's servers. MCP reads all of it (`discord_status`,
`discord_check` and the page's `Discord*` values; see [MCP](MCP.md)).

## Architecture

- `src\Martlet.Discord` (`net10.0`, NetCord): `DiscordBot` (the gateway connection, its status and events),
  `DiscordPreferences` (`discord.json` in the data directory: application ID, credential reference, people, chat modes, channel
  rules, home server), `DiscordInvite` (portal and invite links, permission bits) and the reply contract
  (`IDiscordReplyEngine`, `DiscordTurn`, `DiscordChatRules`).
- `src\Martlet.Desktop\DiscordService*.cs`: the desktop host. `DiscordService.cs` owns the preferences, the token in
  `WindowsCredentialStore` (`Martlet/v3/discord-bot/<id>`) and the bot's lifetime (connects at start when enabled). Text chat,
  voice and companion features are partial files that attach to `DiscordService.Bot`.
- Replies go through `IDiscordReplyEngine`, separate from the local `LiveConversationController`, with its own history per
  Discord place. It reuses the persona, Thinking route and memory, and must never add latency to, block or evict the local
  conversation (see AGENTS.md).
- Voice converts Discord's 48 kHz stereo Opus to Martlet's canonical 16 kHz mono PCM per speaker for speech-to-text, and
  speech output back to 48 kHz Opus.

## Workstreams

1. **Foundation** (merged first): the project, NetCord, preferences, bot host, token vault, reply contract and this page.
2. **Setup and status**: Companion › Discord page (guided setup, token, invite links, on/off, status, chat modes, people),
   MCP `SafeValues`/`SafeClicks`, a Doctor probe and `docs\MCP.md`.
3. **Reply engine**: `IDiscordReplyEngine` over Martlet's persona, Thinking route and memory, per-place history and the
   "should I say something" decision for ambient turns.
4. **Text chat**: server channels, DMs and threads with chat modes, mentions and replies, typing, rate limits and
   `/martlet` for the user-installed app.
5. **Voice**: `/join`, `/leave`, follow the owner and being moved in, per-speaker listening and speech-to-text, speaking
   replies, Sometimes mode in group calls, DAVE native libraries.
6. **Companion presence**: the People list as Martlet's friends, calling someone through its home server, presence status
   and the bot's avatar following the character.
